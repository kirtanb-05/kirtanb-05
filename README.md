# Hi there <img src="https://community.facer.io/uploads/default/original/3X/d/0/d011405990682a3ee8b640a013562a84edb8c702.gif" width="30" />


I'm [Kirtan](https://kirtanb-05.github.io/Portfolio/), an engineering student, engineering is not engineering atm.

I brainstorm and try to build whatever I can imagine.  

Most ideas stay in my head longer than they should — incubation period, not procrastination.

My main tech stack is JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and ChatGPT.

I've created and deleted over 1000 repositories.  

Think of it as R&D… with a very low success rate.

Fun facts:
- I am Iron Man (no suit yet, still working on the arc reactor)
- Robin Williams is my favorite actor
- Movies > Sleep
